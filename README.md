Hanabi
========

Hanabi is a **collaborative** game of **imperfect information**, created by *Antoine Bauza*.
The goal of the players is to coordinate in order to correctly play a series of firework cards, without causing accidents.

This project's goal is to create and train a *neural network* which will enable the computer to learn how to play the game of Hanabi.
No strategies are hardcoded, therefore the computer must learn how to play by generating and analyzing a large number of games.

The code is written in Python, and (for now) it only implements the rules of the game.
It can be used in order to launch games where all the players are simulated by the computer, and they play with a totally random strategy.
The machine learning component (based on neural networks) will be uploaded later.
